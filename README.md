# 📊Mobile-Phone-Data-Analysis-with-Python
🚀 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of 75,600 rows containing mobile phone data, including prices, ratings, and battery health. Using Python, I applied data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques to uncover meaningful insights.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

NumPy for numerical operations

Jupyter Notebook for coding and documentation

🔎 Analysis Highlights

Bar Charts to compare phone model popularity

Scatter Plots to evaluate price vs. ratings

Box Plots to analyze battery health variability

Heat Maps to uncover brand trends

📈 Key Insights

Samsung holds a dominant market share.

iPhone prices showed fluctuations in 2022.

Battery health tends to be more consistent in iPhone models.

No strong correlation was found between price and user ratings.
